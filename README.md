# BrickBreaker

A group school project in progress...

## Development:

We will use a timer to create the game cycle.


**The game will have nine class files and one interface file:**


- Main.java - *is the class that holds the main method and starts our game.*


- GameObject.java - *is the base class for all the game objects in the game.*


- Paddle.java - *is the class that will encapsulate the paddle object in our game which will be controlled with the left and right arrow keys.*


- Ball.java - *is the class that will create our ball objects in the game and will set their speed and movements.*


- Brick.java - *is the class that will create our brick objects.*


- Board.java - *is the class that will hold our main game logic.*


- Breakout.java - *is the class that creates the frame, menu items, and adds the game board.*


- Animate.java - *is the class for actions to be performed by the timer task.*


- Spider.java - *is the class that creates the power-ups objects.*


- Commons.java - *is our interface file that will hold the game constants.*
